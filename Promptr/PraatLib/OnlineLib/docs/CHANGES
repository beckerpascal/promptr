Changes from 0.3alpha to 0.3
----------------------------

* The library now compiles into libpraat.a rather than praat.a
* Documentation update

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3alpha:
-----------------------------

* Praatlib 0.3 is based on Praat 5.0.3.0.

* The window function constants have been adjusted to reflect the
corresponding changes in praat. Look them up in "src/library/praatsound.h"
for now. In particular, "wfNone" has become "wfRectangular".

* This new version of Praat has more library dependencies. See the
"makefile" in "sample" directory for the linker arguments (the stuff at the
end of the "g++" command line).

* Incorporated the patch suggested by Benoit and a bugfix by Joan.
